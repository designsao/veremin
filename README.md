# Veremin

This repository contains a video theremin based on [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet).

The PoseNet [Camera Demo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet/demos#demo-1-camera) is modified to allows you to make music by moving your hands/arms in front of a web camera.

PoseNet is used to predict the position of your wrists within the video. The app takes the prediction and converts them to raw MIDI values and sent to a connected MIDI device.

The app is currently a **work in progress** and only supports the Chrome browser (version 43 or later).


## Featured technologies

- [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) - a machine learning model which allows for real-time human pose estimation in the browser
- [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org) - a JavaScript library for training and deploying ML models in the browser and on Node.js
- [Web MIDI API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi) - an API supporting the MIDI protocol, enabling web applications to enumerate and select MIDI input and output devices on the client system and send and receive MIDI messages
- [Web Audio API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio) - a high-level Web API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications


## Live demo

To see this app in action without installing anything, simply visit https://veremin.mybluemix.net with a Chrome browser.


## Steps

Follow these steps to deploy your own instance of Veremin.

It can be deployed to IBM Cloud. You can also run this app on your local machine for development purposes.

- [Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://github.com/vabarbosa/veremin#deploy-to-ibm-cloud)
- [Run locally](https://github.com/vabarbosa/veremin#deploy-to-ibm-cloud)

### Deploy to IBM Cloud

Pre-requisites:

- Get an [IBM Cloud account](https://console.bluemix.net/)
- Install/Update the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud/download_cli.html#install_use)
- [Configure and login](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html#overview) to the IBM Cloud using the CLI

To deploy to the IBM Cloud, from a terminal run:

1. Clone the `veremin` locally:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/vabarbosa/veremin
    ```

1. Change to the directory of the cloned repo

    ```
    $  cd veremin
    ```

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account:

    ```
    $ ibmcloud login
    ```

1. Target a Cloud Foundry org and space:

    ```
    $ ibmcloud target --cf
    ```

1. Push the app to IBM Cloud

    ```
    $ ibmcloud cf push
    ```
    Deploying can take a few minutes.

1. View the app (with Chrome) at the URL listed in the output

### Run locally

To run the app locally, from a terminal run:

1. Clone the `veremin` locally:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/vabarbosa/veremin
    ```

1. Change to the directory of the cloned repo

    ```
    $  cd veremin
    ```

1. Point your web server to your app directory and start it up. If you want to use the **Web Server for Chrome** (and have installed it from the Chrome Web Store)

    1. Go to your Chrome browser's Apps page
    1. Click on the **Web Server**
    1. From the Web Server, click **CHOOSE FOLDER** and select the directory of the cloned repo
    1. Start the Web Server

1. View the app (with Chrome) at the web server URL


## Using the app

Connect and configure a MIDI synthesizer to your computer. If you do not have a MIDI synthesizer you can try a software synthesizer such as [SimpleSynth](http://notahat.com/simplesynth/). If no (hardware or software) synthesizer is detected the app defaults to using the Web Audio API to generate tones from the browser.

You will need to view the app with Chrome and accept the prompt to allow access the web camera. Once accepted the PoseNet model gets loaded (it may take a few seconds).

After the model is loaded, the video will load and include an overlay with skeleton and joints information detected by PoseNet. The overlay also include two adjacent boxes. When your wrists are within each of the boxes, you should here some tones.

You can move your arm/hands around to generate different tones to send to the connected MIDI device.

Click on **Open Controls** to open the control panel. In the control panel you are able to change MIDI device, view the raw MIDI values being sent, configurable PoseNet settings, and additional optionals to configure the for the video.
